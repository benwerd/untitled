# 06. On requisitioning

> *The next generation of lens development is proving to be a qualified success. Certainly, it is not apparent to most users that their lenses can be used in this way. However, once they are added to the next level network, any misgivings are easily overcome. Yes, sometimes users must be requisitioned. But most users will easily accept this as a necessary part of keeping them safe. Our focus, then, is not on removing the need or facility to requisition user bodies for security purposes, but on reducing user discomfort with the process. I recommend a user experience study.*
