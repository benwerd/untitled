# 10. On the notion of devolved responsibilities

> *The United Kingdom, of course, remains just a satellite of our head office. It shall be responsible for local decisions and for taking on local liabilities, in line with policy set in Menlo Park. We do not anticipate devolving overall responsibility globally, and our satellite offices should be staffed accordingly. Obviously, local staff should be modified in the usual ways, to ensure adherence with overall policy.*
