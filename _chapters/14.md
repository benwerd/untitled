> *The indie lens project has been a resounding success. While we do not retain direct ownership of the lens infrastructure on paper, our direct influence of the principals allows us to fully influence its development while avoiding the scrutiny that has afflicted the project in the past.*
>
> *We recommend that we continue with this project into the future, and sunset any public Menlo Park Corporation involvement. As we have demonstrated, there is no need to obtain attribution for this work so long as our goals are met and we retain ownership of the data and roadmap.*
